/*
  A character is a so called primitive data type.
  Primitive data types are stored by value and not by reference.
  A character can present: letters, punctuation symbols, comparison operators

  the quote below is from Lynda.com
  https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/Understanding-data-types/
  The character data type is interesting, because it stores all characters,
  numbers, and symbols. As decimal values.
  For example, the letter capital A, is stored as the number 65.
  We can see the translation of all the codes using an ASCII code table,
  which provides the character and coding scheme, used universally
  by both programming languages.
